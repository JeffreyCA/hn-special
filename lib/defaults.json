    "<em>Open links in new tabs</em> also makes links inside comments open up in separate tabs!",
    "You can pause infinite scrolling by clicking on \"pause infinite scrolling\", next to \"More\"!",
    "<em>Accurate domain names</em> shows you more precisely where a link takes (e.g., <em>github.com</em> becomes <em>gist.github.com</em>)!",
    "You can try <em>High contrast</em> if you have issues reading some of the text on the site.",
    "<em>Highlight links when returning</em> will help you find which link you came from when coming back to Hacker News!",
    "<em>Mark as read</em> allows you to mark links as visited, or to mark an entire page of links as read.",
    "Use <em>Sticky header</em> if you'd like to make the header follow you through the page.",
    "<em>Gray visited links</em> could make it easier for you to distinguish the links you haven't clicked on yet.",
    "<em>User tooltips</em> give you information about users just by hovering their name with your cursor.",
    "<em>Hide downvote</em> lets you encourage yourself to reply rather than downvoting a comment."
